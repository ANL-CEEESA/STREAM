### Decarbonization Roadmapping and Energy, Environmental, Economic, and Equity Analysis Model

This is the implementation of the framework for the planning of the
technological makeup of the industrial sector.

Motivated by the efforts to achieve carbon neutrality, the model of this
framework modifies the portfolio of technologies over time for the sector of
interest such that,

<ol type="a"> <li>Net Present Value (NPV) is minimized</li> <li>Constraint on
Greenhouse Emissions (GHG), e.g. carbon dioxide, is satisfied</li> <li>Demand of
the underlying commodity is satisfied</li> </ol>

The current implementation reflects a case study for the electric power sector.

The for a given initial set of capacities of different vintages, the space of
decisions include,

- *Retirement* of the existing capacities.
- *Retrofitting* the existing capacities to alternative characteristics.
- *Creation* of new capacities from a technology portfolio.

All the associated quantities with the deployments, e.g. CO<sub>2</sub>, heat
requirement, etc.
