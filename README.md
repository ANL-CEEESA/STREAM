### (The Decarbonization Roadmapping and Energy, Environmental, Economic, and Equity Analysis Model)

This is the implementation of the framework for the planning of the
technological makeup of the industrial sector.

Motivated by the efforts to achieve carbon neutrality, the model of this
framework modifies the portfolio of technologies over time for the sector of
interest such that,
<ol type="a">
  <li>Net Present Value (NPV) is minimized</li>
  <li>Constraint on Greenhouse Emissions (GHG), e.g. carbon dioxide, is satisfied</li>
  <li>Demand of the underlying commodity is satisfied</li>
</ol>
